# express-notepad-

## Description 
I Created an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.


## Installation 
If all the files are kept in a single fold and the user uses the server.js file to run the program in the terminal 

## Usage
The usage was to continue building our skills wit node.js, using the terminal and working with express to complete the backend. 

## Credit
I created this project from the outline given to us by our Triology Education Services instructor. I also took code from my old homework, inclasss activities. My instructor and TAs also  gave me guidance while working on thsi project. . I had additional help from my tutors Isabel Arcones and Andy Gikling. Most of the front end was already completed for me. I only had to fix a few small portions. 

## Contributing 
I built this application with the help from my instructor and TAs from Triology. I also had addditoinal help from my classmates and tutors. 

## Challenges
I found this whole activity to be challanging. I had never saved anything to a database.  I struggle with using documentation to figure out the problem at hand, expectional when its a language that I'm not familiar with.
