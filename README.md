# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description 
This application would be used to help generate a roster of employees for a project. 


## Installation 
If all the files are kept in a single fold and the user installs jest and inquirer the user should be able to build an employee team with a manager, engineers and interns.  

## Usage
The usage was to continue building our skills wit node.js and using the terminal. The we also had to use the following resources: [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for running the provided tests, and [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user. 

## Credit
I created this project from the outline given to us by our Triology Education Services instructor. I also took code from my old homework, inclasss activities. My instructor and TAs also  gave me guidance while working on thsi project. . I had additional help from my tutors Isabel Arcones and Andy Gikling. 

## Contributing 
I built this application with the help from my instructor and TAs from Triology. I also had addditoinal help from my classmates and tutors. 

## Challenges
I had issues with my for loop and using inquirer. The for loop was running while I was trying to answer the questions about job title. The loop would continue to run before I could answer the questions. I was not able to fix this issue. Because of this "bug" I was not able to finish the homework in time.
